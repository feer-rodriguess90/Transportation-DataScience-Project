# Transportation-DataScience-Project
## Overview:
This project aims to analyze motor vehicle collision data to gain insights into road safety trends and contributing factors. By examining collision patterns, geographic distributions, and temporal trends, we seek to identify areas for targeted interventions and enhance road safety measures.
> Hosted by the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub & National Student Data Corps, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.

## Data Source:

The analysis utilizes the Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset, containing detailed information on collision incidents recorded over a specific timeframe.

## Project Objectives:
- Analyze motor vehicle collision data to identify key contributing factors and trends.
- Explore geographic patterns of collisions to pinpoint high-risk areas and disparities in safety outcomes.
- Assess temporal trends in collision frequency to inform targeted interventions and resource allocation.
- Provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, transportation agencies, and community stakeholders to enhance road safety measures and mitigate collision risks.

## Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of variables.
- Visualization of key insights using matplotlib and seaborn.
- Documentation of analysis steps, insights, and recommendations.

## Dependencies:
- Google Colab Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Streamlit
- Folium
- Statsmodels

## Next Steps 
- Interactive visualization with Tableau **(In progess)**
- Disseminate findings through presentations, reports, and awareness campaigns to promote informed decision-making in road safety initiatives.
